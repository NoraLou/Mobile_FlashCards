# Mobile_FlashCards

This app was created as the out of class project for the Udacity React-Native course.
Users can create decks of flash-cards and quiz themselves.  A local notification reminds you to study daily.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This app was built for ios devices and was tested on an iphone 7 via the xcode simulator.

## Requirements

This project requires Node v6 or later on your machine and yarn or npm v3, or v4. I used yarn to be on the safe side as npm v5 will create errors.

To install yarn please see (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

The install steps below rely on xcode being installed on your machine. To view the app in another device or simulator please refer to the documentation [Here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This project uses Expo to assit with device simulation to learn more about device simulation options with Expo please refer to the documentation [Here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/index.html).
